\title{Bin observations by taxa according to some common factor
This version allows for summing over some factor like dry mass or volume}
\usage{
bin_taxa(
  df,
  depth_breaks,
  zooscan = F,
  func_col = "taxo_name",
  func = length,
  force_bins = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame should have a taxo_name, name, or object_annotation_category column}

\item{depth_breaks}{the limits of what bins should be made}

\item{zooscan}{if the df is a zooscan export set to true, default false}

\item{func_col}{a single character vector of the value to apply function to; esd, biomass, drymass, etc}

\item{func}{the function to apply}

\item{force_bins}{set to true if you want to ensure observations for all 0's}
}
\description{
It will sum for each individual in a depth bin by taxa
